:target{#deployment-with-trusted-third-party}

# Deployment with Trusted Third Party

This document describes how to deploy a SCQL system in centralized mode with docker, and use scdbclient to query, it’s basically same with [Centralized Deployment Quickstart Tutorial](../../intro/tutorial.mdx), but deployed in multi-machine.

Before start this doc, we assume that the reader has some experience using the docker-compose utility. If you are new to Docker Compose, please consider reviewing the [official Docker Compose overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), or checking out the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/).

:target{#deployment-diagram}

## Deployment Diagram

The deployment diagram of the SCQL system that we plan to deploy is shown as the following figure, it involves a total of three party, including a trusted third-party and two data owner parties named `Alice` and `Bob`. We use three machines to simulate different parties.

![](../../_assets/deployment.png)

<Container type="note">
  1. The SCDB is served through the HTTP protocol. It is recommended to use HTTPS instead in production environments. Please check [<span>TLS Configuration</span>](../../reference/engine-config.mdx#scdb-tls) for details.
</Container>

:target{#step-1-deploy-scqlengine}

## Step 1: Deploy SCQLEngine

Here we present how to deploy engine in party Alice, it’s same with party Bob.

:target{#create-a-workspace}

### 1.1 Create a Workspace

```bash
mkdir engine
cd engine
```

:target{#set-dataset}

### 1.2 Set Dataset

The database in Engine is use to storage the origin data. In this document we will use MySQL as the database service, and simulate a dataset. However, if you prefer, you can use your preferred database service.

To simulate a dataset, you need create a sql init file named alice\_init.sql in your workspace, which corresponds to [alice\_init.sql](https://github.com/secretflow/scql/tree/main/examples/scdb-tutorial/mysql/initdb/alice_init.sql). For Bob, please use [bob\_init.sql](https://github.com/secretflow/scql/tree/main/examples/scdb-tutorial/mysql/initdb/bob_init.sql) instead.

This file can also be obtained via the command-line with either curl, wget or another similar tool.

```bash
wget raw.githubusercontent.com/secretflow/scql/main/examples/scdb-tutorial/mysql/initdb/alice_init.sql
```

:target{#set-engine-config}

### 1.3 Set Engine Config

Create a file called `gflags.conf` in your workspace and paste the following code in:

```bash
--listen_port=8080
--datasource_router=embed
--enable_driver_authorization=false
--server_enable_ssl=false
--driver_enable_ssl_as_client=false
--peer_engine_enable_ssl_as_client=false
--embed_router_conf={"datasources":[{"id":"ds001","name":"mysql db","kind":"MYSQL","connection_str":"db=alice;user=root;password=__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__;host=mysql;auto-reconnect=true"}],"rules":[{"db":"*","table":"*","datasource_id":"ds001"}]}
# party authentication flags
--enable_self_auth=true
--enable_peer_auth=true
--private_key_pem_path=/home/admin/engine/conf/ed25519key.pem
--authorized_profile_path=/home/admin/engine/conf/authorized_profile.json
```

See [Engine configuration options](../../reference/engine-config.mdx#engine-config-options) for more config information

<Container type="note" id="replace-root-password">
  The `connection_str` specified in `embed_router_conf` is utilized to connect database named alice as set in [1.2 Set Dataset](#set-dataset), For Bob it should be set to connect database named bob.

  The `__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__` should be replaced with the password set by the corresponding party, and please replace this placeholder in the same way for subsequent files.
</Container>

:target{#create-docker-compose-file}

### 1.4 Create docker-compose file

Create a file called `docker-compose.yaml` in your workspace and paste the following code in:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  engine:
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    command:
      - /home/admin/bin/scqlengine
      - --flagfile=/home/admin/engine/conf/gflags.conf
    restart: always
    image: secretflow/scql:latest
    ports:
      - __ALICE_PORT__:8080
    volumes:
      - ./gflags.conf:/home/admin/engine/conf/gflags.conf
      - ./ed25519key.pem:/home/admin/engine/conf/ed25519key.pem
      - ./authorized_profile.json:/home/admin/engine/conf/authorized_profile.json
  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
    healthcheck:
      retries: 10
      test:
        - CMD
        - mysqladmin
        - ping
        - -h
        - mysql
      timeout: 20s
    expose:
      - "3306"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./alice_init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/alice_init.sql
```

<Container type="note">
  `__ALICE_PORT__`  is the published port on the host machine which is used for engine service to listen on, you need to replace it with an accessible port number. In this case, we have designated it as `8080`

  Container <em>mysql</em> is init by `alice_init.sql` as set in [1.2 Set Dataset](#set-dataset) , it should be `bob_init.sql` for Bob. If you use your own database service, container <em>mysql</em> can be deleted

  Please remember to replace `__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__` with the same password [<span>as before</span>](#replace-root-password)
</Container>

:target{#prepare-party-auth-files}

### 1.5 Prepare Party Auth Files

The party authentication flags are enabled in `gflags.conf`, so we need to generate private key and authorized\_profile.

```bash
# generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out ed25519key.pem
# get public key corresponding to the private key, the output can be used to replace the __ALICE_PUBLIC_KEY__ in engine Bob's authorized_profile.json
# for engine Bob,  the output can be used to replace the __BOB_PUBLIC_KEY__ in engine Alice's authorized_profile.json
openssl pkey -in ed25519key.pem  -pubout -outform DER | base64
# download authorized profile
# for engine Bob, use command: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretflow/scql/main/examples/scdb-tutorial/engine/bob/conf/authorized_profile.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secretflow/scql/main/examples/scdb-tutorial/engine/alice/conf/authorized_profile.json
```

Then you need to replace `__BOB_PUBLIC_KEY__` in authorized\_profile.json with Bob’s public key. For engine Bob, please replace the `__ALICE_PUBLIC_KEY__`

:target{#start-engine-service}

### 1.6 Start Engine Service

The file your workspace should be as follows:

```bash
└── engine
  ├── alice_init.sql
  ├── authorized_profile.json
  ├── docker-compose.yaml
  ├── ed25519key.pem
  └── gflags.conf
```

Then you can start engine service by running docker compose up

```bash
# If you install docker with Compose V1, pleas use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

Creating network "engine_default" with the default driver
Creating engine_engine_1 ... done
Creating engine_mysql_1  ... done
```

You can use docker logs to check whether engine works well

```bash
$ docker logs -f engine_engine_1

[info] [main.cc:main:297] Started engine rpc server success, listen on: 0.0.0.0:8080
```

SCQLEngine is listening on `8080`.

:target{#step-2-deploy-scdb}

## Step 2: Deploy SCDB

This chapter will demonstrate how to deploy SCDB in a Third-Party

:target{#id1}

### 2.1 Create a Workspace

```bash
mkdir scdb
cd scdb
```

:target{#set-scdb-config}

### 2.2 Set SCDB Config

Create a file called `config.yml` in your workspace and paste the following code in:

```yaml
scdb_host: scdb:8080
port: 8080
protocol: http
query_result_callback_timeout: 3m
session_expire_time: 24h
session_expire_check_time: 1m
log_level: debug
storage:
  type: mysql
  conn_str: "root:__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__@tcp(mysql:3306)/scdb?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local&interpolateParams=true"
  max_idle_conns: 10
  max_open_conns: 100
  conn_max_idle_time: 2m
  conn_max_lifetime: 5m
engine:
  timeout: 120s
  protocol: http
  content_type: application/json
  spu: |
    {
      "protocol": "SEMI2K",
      "field": "FM64"
    }
party_auth:
  method: pubkey
  enable_timestamp_check: true
  validity_period: 1m
```

See [SCDB configuration options](../../reference/engine-config.mdx#scdb-config-options) for more config information

<Container type="note">
  `conn_str` is utilized to connect database named scdb which will be deployed in next step, if you prefer, you can also use your own database service.

  Please remember to replace `__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__` with the same password  [<span>as before</span>](#replace-root-password)
</Container>

:target{#id2}

### 2.4 Create docker-compose file

Create a file called `docker-compose.yaml` in your workspace and paste the following code in:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  scdb:
    image: secretflow/scql:latest
    environment:
      - SCQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
    command:
      - /home/admin/bin/scdbserver
      - -config=/home/admin/configs/config.yml
    restart: always
    ports:
      - __SCDB_PORT__:8080
    volumes:
      - ./config.yml:/home/admin/configs/config.yml
  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=scdb
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
    healthcheck:
      retries: 10
      test:
        - CMD
        - mysqladmin
        - ping
        - -h
        - mysql
      timeout: 20s
    expose:
      - "3306"
    restart: always
```

<Container type="note">
  `__SCDB_PORT__` is the published port on the host machine which is used for scdb service to listen on, you need to replace it with an accessible port number. Here, it’s set as 8080

  Please remember to replace `__MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD__` with the same password  [<span>as before</span>](#replace-root-password)
</Container>

:target{#start-scdb-service}

### 2.5 Start SCDB Service

The file your workspace should be as follows:

```bash
└── scdb
  ├── scdb_init.sql
  ├── config.yml
  └── docker-compose.yaml
```

Then you can start engine service by running docker compose up

```bash
# If you install docker with Compose V1, pleas use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

Creating scdb_mysql_1 ... done
Creating scdb_scdb_1  ... done
```

You can use docker logs to check whether engine works well

```bash
$ docker logs -f scdb_scdb_1

INFO main.go:122 Starting to serve request with http...
```

SCDB is listening on `8080`, waiting for connection

:target{#step-3-scql-test}

## Step 3: SCQL Test

Here we use scdbclient to submit a query to SCDB for testing, you can also submit queries directly to SCDB by sending a POST request. This step can be completed on any machine that has access to the SCDB ip address.

You can read [How to use SCDBClient](https://github.com/secretflow/scql/tree/main/cmd/scdbclient/README.md) for more information about scdbclient.

:target{#build-scdbclient}

### 3.1 Build scdbclient

```bash
# Grab a copy of scql:
git clone git@github.com:secretflow/scql.git
cd scql

# build scdbclient from source
# requirements:
#   go version >= 1.19
go build -o scdbclient cmd/scdbclient/main.go

# try scdbclient
./scdbclient --help
```

:target{#set-client-config}

### 3.2 Set Client Config

Create a json file named as `users.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "alice": {
    "UserName": "alice",
    "Password": "some_password"
  },
  "bob": {
    "UserName": "bob",
    "Password": "another_password"
  },
  "root": {
    "UserName": "root",
    "Password": "root"
  }
}
```

<Container type="note">
  The `root` user is the admin user of SCDB which is init when scdb container set up, `alice` and `bob` are the user belong to party Alice and Bob,

  The user information for `alice` and `bob` should be same with the user information you will create.
</Container>

:target{#submit-query}

### 3.3 Submit Query

You can start to use scdbclient to submit queries to SCDBServer and fetch the query results back. it’s same as what you can do in [Centralized Deployment Quickstart Tutorial](../../intro/tutorial.mdx)

```bash
# use scdbclient to connect to scdbserver
./scdbclient prompt --host=__SCDB_URL__ --usersConfFileName=users.json --sync
> switch root
# create our first db demo
root> create database demo
[fetch] OK for DDL/DML
root> show databases;
[fetch]
1 rows in set: (2.945772ms)
+----------+
| Database |
+----------+
| demo     |
+----------+
...
```

<Container type="note">
  `__SCDB_URL__` is the url (eg\:http\://127.0.0.1:8080) where scdb service is listen on, you need to replace it with scdb service url.

  Because the SCQLEngine listening URL of quickstart is different from that of distributed deployment, if you encounter an error similar to the following, please use the `alter user` query to specify the correct listening URL, like: 30.30.30.30:8080

  > \[fetch]err: Code: 300, message\:Post “http\://engine\_alice:8080/SCQLEngineService/RunExecutionPlan”: dial tcp engine\_alice:8080: connect: connection refused
</Container>
