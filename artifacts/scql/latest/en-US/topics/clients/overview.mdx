# How To Integrate SCQL System

:target{#overview}

## Overview

As shown in FIG, SCQL System needs to work with <strong>Client</strong>:

- Client: user interface designed for query submission and result retrieval.

Therefore the platform should support Client to integrate SCQL System.

Specifically, the Client interact with SCDB through Query API.

:target{#query-api}

## Query API

For SQL query, SCDB support services:

- Submit: async API, just submit SQL query and return, server listen on `${SCDBHost}/public/submit_query`
- Fetch: async API, try to get the result of a SQL query, server listen on `${SCDBHost}/public/fetch_result`
- SubmitAndGet: sync API, submit query and wait to get the query result, server listen on `${SCDBHost}/public/submit_and_get`

Please refer to [SCQL API](../../reference/http-api.mdx) for details.

<Container type="note">
  - Client can choose to support either async or sync API according to business scenarios:
    > If the SQL query task might take too much time, it is recommended to use the async API, otherwise use the sync API for simplicity.
</Container>

In a word, the custom Client should construct HTTP request for userâ€™s SQL, post to SCDB and parse the response from SCDB.
