# Federated Learning

Federated learning is a popular distributed machine learning framework in which clients aggregate their learned models without sharing their individual data under privacy-preserving consideration. However, FL is still facing many challenges, among which efficiency, accuracy, security and fairness challenges are the main problems that hinder the development of FL.

1. [Survey](survey.mdx)
2. [Datasets](datasets.mdx)
3. [Efficiency](Efficiency.mdx)
   Computation,Communication,Quantization
4. [Effectiveness](Effectiveness.mdx)
   Non\_IID, Accuracy challenge, Convergence, Robustness
5. [Incentive](incentive.mdx)
6. [Vertical FL](vertical.mdx)
7. [Boosting](boosting.mdx)
8. [Application](application.mdx)
