# <Target id="id1" />Getting started

Welcome to SecretFlow!

Please follow the [Deployment](deployment.mdx#deployment) and [Installation](installation.mdx#installation) documentation to get SecretFlow ready.

Then, we encourage you to check [Tutorial](../tutorial/index.mdx#tutorial) to play with SecretFlow.

After that, please check [User Guide](../user_guide/index.mdx#user-guide) which are first-party algorithms, tools and utilities to facilitate your development.

If you would like to integrate SecretFlow algorithms to your privacy-preserving systems with a unified interface, we encourage you to check [Component](../component/index.mdx#component).

Finally, please refer to [Developer](../developer/index.mdx#developer) and [API Documentation](../api/index.mdx#api) when you write you own SecretFlow programs.
