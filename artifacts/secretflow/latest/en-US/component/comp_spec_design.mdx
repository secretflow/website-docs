:target{#notes-on-extended-specification}

# Notes on Extended Specification

Extended Specification are for SecretFlow only and not application to other privacy-preserving applications.

If you are looking for definition like DistData, NodeEvalParam, etc. They are part of [SecretFlow Open Specification](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/spec/latest).

:target{#secretflow-cluster}

## SecretFlow Cluster

Defined in cluster.proto.

:target{#sfclusterdesc}

### SFClusterDesc

SFClusterDesc stores intrinsic properties of a SecretFlow cluster, including:

- sf\_version: SecretFlow version
- py\_version: Python version
- parties: Parties participated in computation
- devices: Security configs of secret devices like protocol of SPU devices.
- ray\_fed\_config: Backend selection of RayFed.

The reason we regard SFClusterDesc as intrinsic properties is because SFClusterDesc is important to data security and integrity.
For example, a DistData generated by one cluster could only consumed by another cluster only if their SFClusterDesc are compatible.

:target{#sfclusterconfig}

### SFClusterConfig

A SFClusterConfig contains all information to setup a SecretFlow cluster, besides <strong>SFClusterDesc</strong>, it contains
public configs and private configs.

<strong>PublicConfig</strong> should be revealed to all parties, including:

- ray\_fed\_config: Addresses for RayFed. Parties need this information to communicate to each other.
- spu\_configs: Addresses for SPU devices. SPU Runtimes of all parties need this information to connect.

<strong>PrivateConfig</strong> is unique to each party, including:

- self\_party: who am I?
- ray\_head\_addr: The address of Ray cluster.

:target{#secretflow-data-types}

## SecretFlow Data Types

Defined in data.proto.

:target{#deviceobjectcollection}

### DeviceObjectCollection

We usually use <strong>DeviceObjectCollection</strong> to represent an MPC models. We would provide more details for this part later.
