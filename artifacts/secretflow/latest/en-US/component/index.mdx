:target{#component}

# <Target id="id1" />Component

SecretFlow Component is based on two Specifications. On the one hand, we obey [SecretFlow Open Specification](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/spec/latest). On the other, we defined cluster config and
some other data types with Extended Specification at [Extended Specification](comp_spec.mdx). Extended Specification only applies on SecretFlow and may not used in other privacy-preserving applications in SecretFlow ecosystem.
The detailed explanation of Extended Specification is at [Notes on Extended Specification](comp_spec_design.mdx).

We wrapped some commonly used SecretFlow applications as SecretFlow Component List. However, it is not final and we are updating the list promptly. The full SecretFlow Component List is available at [SecretFlow Component List](comp_list.mdx).

Now, you could run SecretFlow applications with component API or CLI apart from writing Python programs. Please check [Guide of SecretFlow Components](comp_guide.mdx).

## Migration to [SecretFlow Open Specification](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/spec/latest)

There are some breaking changes after introduction of <strong>SecretFlow Open Specification</strong>, including

:target{#comp-proto}

### comp.proto

1. <em>comp.proto</em> is renamed to <em>component.proto</em>
2. In message <em>AttrType</em>, <em>AT\_UNDEFINED</em> is replaced with <em>ATTR\_TYPE\_UNSPECIFIED</em>
3. In message <em>Attribute</em>, <em>has\_lower\_bound</em> is renamed to <em>lower\_bound\_enabled</em> and <em>has\_upper\_bound</em> is renamed to <em>upper\_bound\_enabled</em>
4. In message <em>IoDef.TableAttrDef</em>, <em>attrs</em> is renamed to <em>extra\_attrs</em>

:target{#data-proto}

### data.proto

1. In message <em>SystemInfo</em>, <em>app\_name</em> is renamed to <em>app</em> while <em>secretflow</em> (SFClusterDesc) is replaced with <em>app\_meta</em> (Any).
2. Message <em>StorageConfig</em> is moved from <em>cluster.proto</em>
3. In message <em>IndividualTable</em> and <em>VerticalTable</em>, <em>num\_lines</em> is renamed to <em>line\_count</em>.
4. In message <em>DistData</em>, <em>sys\_info</em> is renamed to <em>system\_info</em>.

We are sorry for inconvenience.

:target{#announcement}

## Announcement

:target{#october-2023}

### October, 2023

1. We officially launched [SecretFlow Open Specification](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/spec/latest) which contains the most common parts which are shared by other privacy-preserving applications.
2. The remaining part are called Extended Specification.

:target{#july-2023}

### July, 2023

From SecretFlow 1.0.0, we officially launch the first version of Component Specification and SecretFlow Component List based on it.
