# Federated NN Model

You could define a federated learning NN model with Tensorflow or PyTorch easily.

Please check API of [`FLModel`](../../../source/secretflow.ml.ml.nn.mdx#secretflow.ml.nn.FLModel "secretflow.ml.nn.FLModel").

You may also check tutorials:

- [Federated Learning for Image Classification](../../../tutorial/Federate_Learning_for_Image_Classification.mdx) This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with TensorFlow.
- [Federated Learning with Pytorch Backend](../../../tutorial/Federated_Learning_with_Pytorch_backend.mdx) This is an example to demonstrate defining a model with PyTorch.

If you are interested, we also encourage you to check [FLModel Design](../../../developer/design/flmodel.mdx).
