where some participants share the same feature space but different in sample.

A typical mix partitioned data.

## Mix Logistic Regression

Secretflow provides [`FlLogisticRegressionMix`](../../source/secretflow.ml.ml.linear.mdx#secretflow.ml.linear.FlLogisticRegressionMix "secretflow.ml.linear.FlLogisticRegressionMix") for logistic regression with mix partitioned data.
You can check the tutorial to have a try.
