# Linear Models

Linear model is a kind of statistical model with simple form and very widely used.
Under the protection of a multi-party secure computing protocol, SecretFlow
implements provably secure linear regression and binary classification
regression through
[minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method](https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/minibatch-sgd.html#minibatches)
for vertically partitioned dataset setting.

The matrix formula for minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is as follows:

Normal:

<InlineMath>${\theta^{t+1}} \leftarrow {\theta^t} - \frac{\alpha}{m}  {X}^T ({X}{\theta^t} - {y})$</InlineMath>

L2 penalty:

<InlineMath>${\theta^{t+1}} \leftarrow {\theta^t} - \frac{\alpha}{m}  ({X}^T ({X}{\theta^t} - {y}) + \lambda {w^t})$</InlineMath>
where
<InlineMath>$w^t_0 = 0, w^t_j = \theta^t_j$</InlineMath>
<InlineMath>$j = 1, \cdots, n$</InlineMath>

SecretFlow provides two provably security implementations of SGD:

- SS-SGD: SS-SGD is short for secret sharing SGD training, uses Secret Sharing to calculate the gradient.
- HESS-SGD: HESS-SGD is short for HE & secret sharing SGD training, uses homomorphic encryption to calculate the gradient.

Secret Sharing is sensitive to bandwidth and latency, and the homomorphic encryption scheme consumes more CPU power.

Secret Sharing can complete the modeling faster with LAN or 10 Gigabit network,
and with limited bandwidth and high latency network environment can use HE to improve the modeling speed.

The two implementations have basically the same logic and algorithm security settings other than gradient calculation.
According to the different CPU/bandwidth of the running environment, you can choose the appropriate implementation to use.

:target{#ss-sgd}

## SS-SGD

The SS-SGD module [<code>SSRegression()</code>](../../source/secretflow.ml.linear.ml.linear.ss_sgd.mdx#secretflow.ml.linear.ss_sgd.model.SSRegression "secretflow.ml.linear.ss_sgd.model.SSRegression")
provides both linear and logistic regression linear models
for vertical split dataset setting by using secret sharing with mini
batch SGD training solver.

[Linear regression](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-regression/linear-regression.html#basics)
fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, …, wp)
to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in
the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

[Logistic regression](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/softmax-regression.html#linear-model)
, despite its name, is a linear model for classification
rather than regression. logistic regression is also known in the literature
as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear
classifier. the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial
are modeled using a logistic function. This method can fit binary regularization
with optional L2 regularization.

A local cluster(Standalone Mode) needs to be initialized as the running environment for this example.

### algorithm details

more detail for logistic regression:

Taking binary regression as an example, the main process is as follows:

> Step 1: Initialize the dataset
>
> - The data provider infeed their dataset into secret sharing and vertically concatenates them as X.
> - The data provide holds Y infeed it into Secret Sharing.
> - Initialize weights w to the initial value set in parameter under Secret Sharing.
> - X.rows must be greater than X.cols, otherwise: 1. model will not converge; 2. Y may leak.
>
> Step 2: Using mini-batch gradient descent, repeat the following steps until the target number of iterations is reached
>
> - Step 2.1: Calculate the predicted value: pred = sigmoid(batch\_x \* w).
>   The sigmoid can be approximated using Taylor expansion, piecewise function, inverse square sigmoid function, etc.
> - Step 2.2: Calculate: err = pred - y
> - Step 2.3: Calculate the gradient: grad = batch\_x.transpose() \* err
> - Step 2.4: If using L2 penalty, update gradient: grad = grad + w’ \* l2\_norm, where the intercept term of w’ is 0
> - Step 2.5: update weights: w = w - (grad \* learning\_rate / batch\_size)
>
> Step 3: Output
> \- At this time, weights w is in the secret sharing. You can output reveal (w) as plaintext or directly save the secret sharing as needed.

:target{#security-analysis}

### Security Analysis

The X/Y/W participating in the calculation are kept in the Secret Sharing from the beginning.
And there is no reveal operation in the calculation process,
so it is impossible to infer the information of the plaintext data through the interactive data in the calculation.

:target{#hess-sgd}

## HESS-SGD

The HESS-SGD module [<code>HESSLogisticRegression()</code>](../../source/secretflow.ml.linear.ml.linear.hess_sgd.mdx#secretflow.ml.linear.hess_sgd.model.HESSLogisticRegression "secretflow.ml.linear.hess_sgd.model.HESSLogisticRegression") implements provably
secure linear regression using homomorphic encryption and Secret Sharing.

The biggest difference from SS-SGD is that the gradient calculation which has the largest communication cost in SS-SGD
is replaced by locally homomorphic calculation implementation.
Due to the asymmetric nature of homomorphic encryption, currently HESS-SGD only supports 2PC.
The algorithm implementation reference is [\<When Homomorphic Encryption Marries Secret Sharing:
Secure Large-Scale Sparse Logistic Regression and Applications
in Risk Control>](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08753.pdf),
and some engineering optimizations are carried out.

### Security Analysis

First, analyze the data interaction in the calculation process to see if there is plaintext information leakage.
There are two types of data interaction in the calculation process:

- \-> Marked HE encryption and decryption process and H2S/S2H encryption state conversion:
  - The security of the HE encryption and decryption process completely depends on the algorithm itself.
  - When H2S creates a secret sharing, it will first mark the random number in the ciphertext and then decrypt it,
    without leaking the plaintext information.
  - S2H will first encrypt one party’s shard, and then reduce other shards on the ciphertext,
    without leaking plaintext information.
- The interaction in the secret sharing and the computing. The security of these processes depends on the mpc protocol used,
  Taking the default ABY3 protocol as an example, in the case of no collusion between SPU nodes,
  it can be guaranteed that no plaintext information can be returned by analyzing the data exchanged between nodes.

The final output result \<w> is stored in the Secret Sharing state, and any w-related information cannot be reversed before reveal \<w>.
