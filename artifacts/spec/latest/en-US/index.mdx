# Welcome to SecretFlow Open Specification

SecretFlow Open Specification is a protocol stack designed for privacy-preserving applications.

At this moment, SecretFlow Open Specification consists of Data, Component and Node Evaluation protocols. We are going to introduce Workflow protocol soon.

SecretFlow Open Specification are used by SecretFlow ecosystem, including:

- SecretFlow: a unified framework for privacy-preserving data analysis and machine learning
- Kuscia: a K8s-based privacy-preserving computing task orchestration framework.
- SecretPad: a privacy-preserving computing web platform based on the Kuscia framework, designed to provide easy access to privacy-preserving data intelligence and machine learning functions.
- SCQL and TEE engine will also use SecretFlow Open Specification in future.
