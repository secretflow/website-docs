# SPU

SPU(Secure Processing Unit) consists of a frontend <strong>compiler</strong> and a backend <strong>runtime</strong>.
The frontend compiler accepts an ML program as input and converts it into an <strong>MPC-specific intermediate representation</strong>.
After a series of delicate code optimizations, programs will be executed by a performant backend runtime as MPC protocols.
Based on SPU, we can run ML programs of different frameworks with minor modifications in a privacy-preserving manner.

SPU is a major part of [SecretFlow](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/secretflow/en/) project.
SPU is designed to be easily integrated into other distributed system, it’s <strong>recommended to use</strong> SecretFlow to write SPU program.
