# SPU

[**SPU**](https://github.com/secretflow/spu) is a domain-specific compiler and runtime suite that aims to provide a secure computation service with provable security.

SPU is a (thing) that let's you (do something) by (doing something else).

- Ease of adoption. The SPU compiler (accepts XLA's HLO IR). Reuse existing (code and compiler infrastructure) to port your (machine learning workflow) to (support MPC), with minimal modification.
- High performance. The SPU suite employs (a variety of novel optimization techniques) to (alleviate the extra computation overhead) (introduced by MPC).
- Provable security.
